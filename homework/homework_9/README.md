How does tsunamis behave as they traverse different seafloor topographies?

In this project, I will investigate the behavior of tsunamis as they traverses across different seafloor topographies. In particular, I will investigate the changes in the tsunami's speed and amplitude as it approaches the coast of Japan versus when it heads off into the deep Pacific Ocean. I will construct a model that encloses the coast of Japan, including the Sea of Japan, and a portion of the Pacific Ocean. I expect the tsunami to travels significantly slower but appears larger in amplitude as it approaches shores and the opposite for a tsunami that heads into deeper waters in the direction of the Pacific Ocean. I expect these results because the continental shelf and slope should exerts a frictional force on the incoming tsunami that forces it to slow down. 

For initial conditions, I will use the ECCO Version 4 Model in 2015.  I intend to simulate tsunamis in different parts of the oceans by raising the sea surface level and observing the effects. Similarly, I will construct boundary and external forcing conditions for this model from the ECCO Version 4 model output. To analyze the results, I will create a time series of the tsunami's velocity and amplitude in different parts of the ocean. For visualization, I will create a movie that displays the velocity and amplitude of the tsunami over time.
